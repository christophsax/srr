## 1. Introduction

[**r**OpenSci](https://ropensci.org) **S**tatistical **S**oftware **R**eview.
This is an R package with functions to help those developing and reviewing
packages submitted to rOpenSci's system for [Statistical Software
Review](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/statistical-software-review-book/index.html).
The functions are mostly intended to ease alignment and assessment of software
against the standards detailed in the [main project
book](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/statistical-software-review-book/index.html)
(from here on referred to as the "SSR Book").
